# XRAY Mini App Cardano Wallet implementation 0001 result

Result-Version: v1
Implementation-ID: xray-mini-app-wallet/0001
Instruction: ./0001-IMPL-INSTR.md
Evidence-Mode: LOCAL

## Change dispositions

| Change ID | Disposition | Implementation | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | IMPLEMENTED | Installed SPECTRE 1.0.0, its generated runtime, canonical templates, README, command router, and repository pointer. | Canonical protocol, runtime, templates, skill, and metadata checks passed. |
| C02 | IMPLEMENTED | Migrated the XRAY Updates ledger, implementation records, and providers into SPECTRE storage. | Every legacy row, instruction, required result, target, and provider inventory was reconciled. |
| C03 | IMPLEMENTED | Applied the human acceptance decision to completed REVIEW records, archived terminal records, and retained PLANNED work as active. | Archive manifests, hashes, state eligibility, active counts, and unique identities were verified. |

## Outcome

Installed SPECTRE 1.0.0 for XRAY Mini App Cardano Wallet and replaced the active XRAY Updates installation. Historical terminal work is available through the SPECTRE archive; planned work remains active.

## Inputs consumed

Consumed the current human migration and acceptance instructions, the pinned SPECTRE protocol, repository guidance, and the complete prior XRAY Updates ledger, records, templates, and provider inventory.

## Project changes

Created the SPECTRE runtime and ledger, migrated records and provider evidence, archived terminal work, retained planned work, updated the repository agent pointer, and removed the superseded active `.xray/` installation. Product implementation files were not otherwise changed.

## Exported change contract

| Change ID | Semantic change | Compatibility | Downstream action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | Explicit SPECTRE commands now govern tracked lifecycle operations. | Ordinary requests remain outside the tracking workflow. | Use `$spectre` explicitly for future lifecycle operations in Codex. |
| C02 | XRAY Updates history is represented in SPECTRE storage without restarting target sequences. | Historical identities and provider evidence remain available. | Allocate future IDs above the highest active or archived ID. |
| C03 | Completed REVIEW work has a human-authorized ACCEPTED decision and all terminal work is archived. | PLANNED work remains active and unimplemented. | Review or implement retained plans only through a later explicit command. |

## Validation

Canonical byte checks, legacy reconciliation, archive hashes, active-ledger state checks, reference inventory, and whitespace validation passed.

## Deviations from instruction

None.

## Remaining human review

None for installation and the explicitly authorized migration decisions. Retained PLANNED work requires a separate explicit implementation command.

## Reproducibility
