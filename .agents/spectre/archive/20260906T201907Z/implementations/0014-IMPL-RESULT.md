# xray-mini-app-wallet implementation 0014 result

Result-Version: v1
Implementation-ID: xray-mini-app-wallet/0014
Instruction: ./0014-IMPL-INSTR.md
Evidence-Mode: LOCAL

## Change dispositions

| Change ID | Disposition | Implementation | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | `IMPLEMENTED` | Moved CIP-67 decoding to `cardanoLib.cips` from `/cardano/lib`. | Typecheck, production build, import audit, and diff check passed. |

## Outcome

Wallet observes the strict Cardano application/library boundary without behavior changes.

## Validation

- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm run build` — passed with local prerender server permission.
- Retired-import audit and `git diff --check` — passed.

## Deviations from instruction

The available Node 20.18.1 runtime is below React Router's requirement; validation still passed.

## Remaining human review

Review the import-only migration.

## Reproducibility

Run the recorded typecheck, build, import audit, and diff check.
