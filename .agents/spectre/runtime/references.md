The two implementation forms in the tree are alternatives and must not be mixed:

- A single-project repository uses the flat form: `implementations/NNNN-IMPL-INSTR.md` and
  `implementations/NNNN-IMPL-RESULT.md`. It has one repository-wide sequence.
- A monorepo uses the nested form: `implementations/<target>/NNNN-IMPL-INSTR.md` and
  `implementations/<target>/NNNN-IMPL-RESULT.md`. Its required bootstrap record uses the reserved
  `repository` target; other sequences are independent per target.

An implementation **target** is the smallest stable monorepo project area with its own source
ownership and meaningful completion validation. Examples include `api`, `web`, `mobile`,
`typescript`, or `payments`. All sequences use four digits beginning at `0001`. Provider sequences
are independent per provider.

Root `SPECTRE.md` is the sole active lifecycle ledger and the project-facing implementation
summary. It aggregates one status section for the repository in flat mode or one section per
target in monorepo mode. Each archived implementation has its sole historical decision row in
one `archive/<archive-id>/ARCHIVE.md`; it has no row in the active ledger. Archive manifests are
immutable history, not additional active ledgers. Target directories contain instructions and
results, not status ledgers. Provider snapshots have no lifecycle ledger and never contain
implementation instructions or results.

Archive directories are created only by a nonempty `/spectre archive` operation. Each batch
preserves the installation's flat or nested layout under its `implementations/` directory.
IDs remain unique across active records and every archive within their original sequence.

### Resolving archived records and references

All SPECTRE operations resolve record IDs and references across the active ledger and every
archive manifest. One implementation ID has exactly one authoritative row and one physical
instruction (and at most one result), either active or archived. Archive dates never change
implementation identity, target ownership, state, or dependency acceptance.

Record contents remain byte-for-byte unchanged, including embedded relative paths. To follow a
repository-relative reference from a record:

1. Use the containing file's original repository location as the base. For an archived record,
   obtain that location from its Record paths entry; for an active record, use its current path.
   Explicit repository-root-relative references keep the repository root as their base.
2. Normalize the referenced path within the repository, retaining any fragment. If it names an
   Original path in an archive manifest, resolve it to that row's Archived file. Otherwise use
   the repository file at that path. Direct links already naming an archived file remain valid.
3. Require a unique existing destination. Reject conflicting active and archived copies, duplicate
   mappings, missing destinations, or escaping paths. For an archived destination, verify its
   digest and the matching decision row before using it as evidence. Never follow a mapping chain.

Apply this to `Depends-On`, input tables, `Instruction`, result references, and provider links;
provider files themselves stay in place. An archived file's raw relative link may require this
original-location resolution rather than ordinary Markdown navigation. The manifest's record
links must work directly, and `status` must return usable links to the resolved files. Do not
rewrite immutable records merely to make their embedded links relative to the archive directory.
