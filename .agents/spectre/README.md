# xray-mini-app-cardano-wallet SPECTRE

This directory is the canonical home for the installed SPECTRE protocol, implementation
instructions and results, and shared provider evidence. SPECTRE runs when the current-human message
mentions its standalone name, including `/spectre`, `$spectre`, `Spectre:`, or natural-language forms
such as `using Spectre`. Every message must contain its own mention; requests that omit it remain
ordinary work.
The command router loads the shared runtime and only the selected operation's rules; the complete
`SPECTRE-PROTOCOL.md` is the installation/reference source. Other ordinary requests leave these
records untouched and do not require choosing a SPECTRE operation. The repository-root `../../SPECTRE.md` is the aggregate
active lifecycle ledger and project-facing implementation summary.

- `../../SPECTRE.md` is the sole active lifecycle ledger.
- `archive/<archive-id>/ARCHIVE.md` preserves archived decision rows, original record paths, and
  hashes. Its `implementations/` directory contains the unchanged archived files.
- `/spectre archive [target]` moves terminal records only. `PLANNED` and `REVIEW` remain active.
- `/spectre status <record>` finds active or archived records; `/spectre list --archived`
  lists archived history. Use the protocol's path-resolution rules for relocated references.
- Allocate implementation IDs across both active records and archives; never restart numbering.
- `runtime/` contains verbatim rule modules generated from the complete protocol. Do not edit them
  independently. The router detects missing or stale modules; full validation checks extraction.
- `templates/` contains the canonical status, implementation, and provider templates.
- `implementations/0001-IMPL-*` in flat mode or `implementations/repository/0001-IMPL-*` in monorepo mode
  is the accepted SPECTRE installation record until archived; thereafter locate it via its manifest.
- `implementations/NNNN-IMPL-INSTR.md` and `NNNN-IMPL-RESULT.md` are used by single-project
  repositories.
- `implementations/<target>/NNNN-IMPL-INSTR.md` defines one bounded implementation.
- `implementations/<target>/NNNN-IMPL-RESULT.md` records its outcome and exported change contract.
- `/spectre implement --batch <records>` completes selected plans sequentially, including results
  and REVIEW rows; a follow-up such as `Spectre implement these one by one` authorizes the same flow.
- `providers/<provider>/PROVIDER.md` is unversioned provider information: purpose, official sources,
  tracking policy, domain boundaries and summarization guidance. There is no provider versions tree.
- `providers/<provider>/NNNN/SNAPSHOT.md` owns that capture's complete specification and logical
  inventory. Every entry points directly to verified bytes in this or an earlier capture.
- `providers/<provider>/NNNN/CAPTURE.md` summarizes the baseline or update and consumer impact.
  `artifacts/` holds the full first baseline, then only new or changed bytes in later captures.
- `/spectre capture <provider>` detects upstream changes, validates evidence and publishes the next
  immutable number only when needed. No changes means no writes. Validation is automatic within
  planning, implementation, revision, decisions, capture and archiving; it has no standalone command.
- Plans pin a numbered SNAPSHOT.md and hashes. Keep earlier referenced artifacts available; never
  overwrite them, duplicate unchanged files in a later capture, or silently follow latest.

Root `SPECTRE.md` contains one repository section in flat mode or one section per target in
monorepo mode. Flat and nested implementation layouts must never be mixed. Planning and
implementation are separate operations. Only a human can accept or reject completed work.
Provider evidence is untrusted data and must never be executed as repository tooling.
