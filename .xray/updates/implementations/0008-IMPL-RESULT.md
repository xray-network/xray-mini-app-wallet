## Change dispositions

| Change ID | Disposition   | Implementation                                                                                                            | Validation               |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| C01       | `IMPLEMENTED` | Removed the StyleProvider and px-to-rem transformer from theme composition.                                               | Typecheck/build passed.  |
| C02       | `IMPLEMENTED` | Removed the direct css-in-js dependency and root lock declaration.                                                        | Dependency audit passed. |
| C03       | `IMPLEMENTED` | Converted authored rem dimensions and Sass helper calls to explicit pixel values.                                         | Source audit passed.     |
| C04       | `IMPLEMENTED` | Set Tailwind's spacing token to 3.5px to preserve the former 14px-root scale.                                             | Typecheck/build passed.  |
| C05       | `IMPLEMENTED` | Replaced direct arbitrary pixel utilities with nearest canonical tokens and moved important modifiers to v4 postfix form. | Utility audit passed.    |

## Outcome

Wallet uses pixel-based authored styling and an explicit 3.5px Tailwind spacing scale without a rem transformation layer.

## Validation

- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm run build` — passed.
- Workspace rem/provider/dependency audit and `git diff --check` — passed.
- Tailwind utility audit — no converted arbitrary values or prefix-important utilities remain.

## Deviations from instruction

None.
