# xray-mini-app-wallet implementation 0001 result

Result-Version: v1
Implementation-ID: xray-mini-app-wallet/0001
Instruction: ./0001-IMPL-INSTR.md
Evidence-Mode: LOCAL

## Change dispositions

| Change ID | Disposition | Implementation | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `C01` | `IMPLEMENTED` | Installed the canonical standard, templates, README, aggregate ledger, and flat bootstrap records. | Required paths, links, IDs, and flat-mode layout verified. |
| `C02` | `IMPLEMENTED` | Added the required root `AGENTS.md` pointer. | Both required bullets occur once. |

## Outcome

XRAY Updates v1 is installed in flat mode with the required accepted bootstrap record.

## Inputs consumed

The human installation request, repository root manifest, and repository structure.

## Project changes

Created `AGENTS.md` and the complete `.xray/updates/` tracking structure. Product source was not changed by installation.

## Exported change contract

| Change ID | Semantic change | Compatibility | Downstream action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `C01` | This repository now uses XRAY Updates v1 with a single flat implementation sequence. | Existing product behavior is unchanged. | Read the local standard before future tracked planning or implementation. |
| `C02` | Root agent guidance points to the local standard and defines silent-mode handling. | No existing guidance was replaced. | Preserve the pointer during future guidance edits. |

## Validation

Canonical files and templates exist; aggregate ledger and bootstrap links resolve; IDs and evidence modes agree; flat and nested layouts are not mixed; the required decision proof is present; no target-local status ledger exists.

## Deviations from instruction

None.

## Remaining human review

None for installation. Future implementations still require normal human review and human-only acceptance.

## Reproducibility

Validate the installation against §13 of `.xray/updates/XRAY-UPDATES.md`.
