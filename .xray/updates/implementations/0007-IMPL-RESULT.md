## Change dispositions

| Change ID | Disposition   | Implementation                                                                                             | Validation                     |
| --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| C01       | `IMPLEMENTED` | Replaced the copy package with the canonical native Clipboard API and embedded-webview fallback component. | Typecheck and build passed.    |
| C02       | `IMPLEMENTED` | Upgraded Ant Design to 6.6.0 and removed the React 19 v5 patch import and dependency.                      | Typecheck and build passed.    |
| C03       | `IMPLEMENTED` | Retained EscapeAntd because Wallet Home consumes its exported context-bound message and notification APIs. | Static audit and build passed. |

## Outcome

Wallet now shares the package-free Copy implementation, resolves Ant Design 6.6.0, and retains only the context escape required by its feedback consumers.

## Inputs consumed

- Human request on 2026-08-11.
- XRAY App canonical Copy implementation.
- Wallet root, theme, Home, and dependency files.

## Project changes

- Removed copy-package and v5-patch imports/dependencies.
- Upgraded Ant Design, css-in-js, and HappyProvider to their v6-aligned releases and refreshed the lockfile.
- Declared `classnames` directly after Ant Design 6 stopped supplying that application dependency transitively.
- Confirmed Wallet Home requires EscapeAntd and retained its App-context mount.

## Exported change contract

| Change ID | Semantic change                                               | Compatibility                                             | Downstream action  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| C01       | Copy uses browser APIs and a local fallback.                  | Tooltip feedback and bubbled child click behavior remain. | None.              |
| C02       | Ant Design resolves to 6.6.0 without a v5 patch.              | React 19 typecheck and production build remain valid.     | Review v6 styling. |
| C03       | Context-bound message and notification exports remain active. | Wallet Home keeps the same feedback imports.              | None.              |

## Validation

- `npm run typecheck` — passed.
- `npm run build` — passed.
- Static dependency/usage audit — v6 provider versions resolve, obsolete packages are absent, and application imports are directly declared.
- `git diff --check` — passed.

## Deviations from instruction

The shared Copy child handling uses the lint-safe canonical inline event wrapper rather than `cloneElement`.

## Remaining human review

- Review Copy tooltip behavior, messages, notifications, and Ant Design 6 presentation.

## Reproducibility

Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check`, then exercise Wallet copy and feedback actions.
