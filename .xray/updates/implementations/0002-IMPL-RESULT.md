Result-Version: v1
Implementation-ID: xray-mini-app-wallet/0002
Instruction: ./0002-IMPL-INSTR.md
Evidence-Mode: LOCAL

## Change dispositions

| Change ID | Disposition | Implementation | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `C01` | `IMPLEMENTED` | Added the typed palette, CSS serializer, `--xr-*` Tailwind mapping, Ant Design themes, and browser theme colors. | Typecheck, production build, and stale-variable scan passed. |
| `C02` | `IMPLEMENTED` | Added an effective-theme hook: SDK host theme while connected, persisted local/system preference while standalone. | Typecheck and source inspection passed; host theme is not persisted. |
| `C03` | `IMPLEMENTED` | Added SSR token injection and the template provider hierarchy while retaining app-specific style imports. | Production client and SPA builds passed. |
| `C04` | `IMPLEMENTED` | Removed duplicate theme state/subscriptions and the legacy theme file; declared CSS-in-JS directly and refreshed npm metadata. | npm lock refresh and stale-code scan passed. |

## Outcome

The wallet frontend now follows the React template's unified theme and style architecture.

## Inputs consumed

The human implementation request, the local React template theme/style modules, and the wallet frontend source and manifest.

## Project changes

Introduced shared theme modules and an XRAY SDK effective-theme integration; migrated CSS and Tailwind to the token namespace; simplified app theme state/effects; updated root metadata/providers and npm metadata.

## Exported change contract

| Change ID | Semantic change | Compatibility | Downstream action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `C01` | Palette values are authored once and consumed by Ant Design, CSS, Tailwind, and browser chrome. | Existing semantic light/dark colors are retained. | Add future design tokens in `app/theme/palette.ts`. |
| `C02` | A connected XRAY host owns the effective theme; standalone mode owns its local/system preference. | Host values never overwrite local preference. | Use the SDK theme hook rather than adding theme message subscriptions. |
| `C03` | Theme providers share one hierarchy and CSS variables are present in initial HTML. | Existing Ant Design context and app styles remain available. | Place UI requiring Ant Design context beneath `Theme`. |
| `C04` | npm declares the CSS-in-JS package used directly by the frontend. | npm remains the only package manager. | Refresh `package-lock.json` after dependency changes. |

## Validation

`npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`; `npm run typecheck`; `npm run build`; stale theme/variable scan; `git diff --check`.

## Deviations from instruction

None.

## Remaining human review

Visually review representative wallet pages in standalone light/dark/system modes and inside an XRAY host.

## Reproducibility

Run `npm run typecheck && npm run build`, then scan `app/` for `var(--color-`, `xray.host.theme`, `getTheme(`, and `initTheme`.
