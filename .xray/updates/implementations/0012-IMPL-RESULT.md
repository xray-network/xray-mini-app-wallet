## Change dispositions

| Change ID | Disposition | Implementation | Validation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | `IMPLEMENTED` | Aligned Router 8.3.0, React/ReactDOM 19.2.8, Node >=22.22.0, and matching Node/React types. | Typecheck, build, and npm audit passed. |
| C02 | `IMPLEMENTED` | Type generation and build required no source or Router config changes. | Typecheck and production build passed. |

## Outcome
